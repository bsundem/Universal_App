# Plugin System Migration

This document provides an overview of the migration to a fully plugin-based architecture for the Universal App.

## Overview

We've transitioned the Universal App to use a plugin-based architecture exclusively, removing the traditional service approach. This enhances separation of concerns, allows for greater extensibility, and makes the application more maintainable.

## Major Changes

### 1. Service Implementation

- Converted all core services to plugins:
  - `RService` → `RServicePlugin`
  - `ActuarialService` → `ActuarialServicePlugin`
  - `FinanceService` → `FinanceServicePlugin`

- Implemented a robust plugin system with:
  - Base plugin classes that handle initialization and shutdown
  - Service plugin architecture for business logic
  - UI plugin architecture for UI components
  - Plugin registry for service discovery

### 2. Core Infrastructure

- Created an event system for inter-service communication
- Implemented a plugin registry that integrates with the DI container
- Added a flexible plugin manager for discovering and loading plugins

### 3. UI Updates

- Updated UI components to handle missing plugins gracefully
- Added error messages when plugins are not available
- Improved error handling in service methods

### 4. Dependency Handling

- Removed direct dependencies on traditional service classes
- Implemented a plugin-based service resolver
- Added graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Testing

A migration script (`migrate_tests_to_plugins.py`) has been provided to help update test files to use the plugin system. This script:

1. Scans test files for references to old service classes
2. Identifies imports and usage patterns
3. Generates recommendations for updating tests

## Cleanup

A cleanup script (`cleanup_redundant_files.py`) has been created to safely remove the old service files:

- `services/r_service.py`
- `services/actuarial/actuarial_service.py`
- `services/finance/finance_service.py`
- `services/actuarial/__init__.py`
- `services/finance/__init__.py`

The script creates backups before removal to ensure no data is lost.

## Benefits of Plugin Architecture

1. **Clean Separation**: Services are fully decoupled from each other and the UI
2. **Event-Based Communication**: Components can communicate without direct references
3. **Extensibility**: New plugins can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Type Safety**: Interfaces define clear contracts for services
5. **Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
6. **Dynamic Loading**: Plugins can be enabled/disabled at runtime

## Next Steps

1. Update test files to use the plugin system
2. Consider adding a settings UI for enabling/disabling plugins
3. Implement additional plugins for new functionality
4. Add automated tests for the plugin system itself

## Example: Using Plugins

### Before:
```python
from services.r_service import RService

r_service = RService()
result = r_service.execute_script("script.R")
```

### After:
```python
from services.container import get_r_service

r_service = get_r_service()  # Gets the plugin implementation
result = r_service.execute_script("script.R")  # Same interface
```
